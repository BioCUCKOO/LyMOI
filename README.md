# LyMOI
**Note**: The LyMOI framework, which incorporated graph neural network (GNN) and large langueage model(LLM), was developed to predict potentially new autophagy regulators and their MMAs from big omics datasets. 

## Requirements

The main requirements are listed below:

* Python 3.8
* torch
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib
  
## OS Requirements

Above codes have been tested on the following systems:

* Windows: Windos10

## Hardware Requirements

All codes and softwares could run on a "normal" desktop computer, no non-standard hardware is needed.

## Installation guide

All codes can run directly on a "normal" computer with Python 3.8 installed, no extra installation is required.

## Instruction

For users who want to run lyMOI in own computer, you should import the required packages. Then set the correct file path, including input and output files, and finally run the .py file of the model to obtain the result file.

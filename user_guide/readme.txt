**Preparation:**  

1. **all_positive_gene.txt**: Positive genes under all conditions.  
2. **single_positive_gene**: Positive genes under specific conditions.  
3. **Omics_feature.txt**: Omics features, where the first column contains gene names, and the subsequent columns represent the integrated omics expression matrix.  
4. **Input_GI.txt**: Each row contains a UniProt ID for gene pairs to be predicted.
